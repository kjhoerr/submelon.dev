A "link-in-bio" site of sorts, with other resources available for reference.

## Description

This is a static site generated and enabled using GatsbyJS. All sources including CSS were produced solely by the author, Kevin Hoerr.

## History

This was originally a purely static site (no JS/TS) that has morphed to permit use of newer technologies and integrations for the ease of updating. There are no server integrations outside of serving static assets. At present, this site does not make use of any scripting features to enable any actual front-end features. The components are built in ReactJS and compiled using the GatsbyJS framework.

## License

This project is licensed under [the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0](LICENSE.md).

## Hosting

The site itself is served using DigitalOcean's App capabilities for static sites. This is a zero-cost service with automated deployments, as enabled by DigitalOcean and GitHub services and integrations.
