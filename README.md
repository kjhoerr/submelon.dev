The front page for [submelon.dev](https://submelon.dev) - a "link-in-bio" site of sorts, with other resources available for reference.

## Description

This is a static site generated and enabled using GatsbyJS. All sources including CSS were produced solely by the author, Kevin Hoerr.

## History

This was originally a purely static site (no JS/TS) that has morphed to permit use of newer technologies and integrations and for ease of updating. There are no server integrations outside of serving static assets. At present, this site does not make use of any scripting features to enable any actual front-end features, though the components are built in ReactJS and compiled using the GatsbyJS framework.

## Hosting

The site itself is served using DigitalOcean's App capabilities for static sites. This is a zero-cost service with automated deployments, as enabled by DigitalOcean and GitHub services and integrations.
